README Tundra Phenology Database
CCIN Reference Number 13215

1. File names, directory structure (for complex datasets), and brief description of each file or file type: 
The datafile: tundra_phenology_database.csv is a .csv file containing dates of phenological observations of 278 plant species at 28 sites in Arctic and sub-arctic alpine ecosystems.

If you are interested in using any phenological data from this database, please contact the relevant data providers.

More information on this database can be found in the publication:

2. Definitions of acronyms, site abbreviations, or other project specific designations used in the data file names or documentation files, if applicable. 
 
3. Definitions of special codes, variable classes, GIS coverage attributes, etc. used in the data files themselves, including codes for missing data values, if applicable: N/A

4. Description of the parameters/variables (column headings in the data files) and units of measure for each parameter/variable:

study_area: Study area name
subsite: Name of subsite location within study area (if applicable)
soil_moisture: General classification of the soil moisture status at a study area or subsite: dry (containing roughly <20% gravimetric soil moisture content (GMC)), moist (20-60% GMC), or wet (>60% GMC) 
lat: Latitude, decimal degrees N
long: Longitude, decimal degrees E
elevation: Elevation (a.s.l.) in meters
ecosystem: Tundra ecosystem type: Arctic (north of latitudinal treeline) or alpine (above elevational treeline)
exstart: Year the experiment or monitoring began at each study area
year: Year of the phenological observation
treatment: Experimental treatment, either CTL (control) or OTC (open-top chamber - experimentally warmed)
plot: Plot within study area or subsite (if applicable)
spp: Species abbreviation
woody: Indicating whether a species is woody (woody) or not (herb)
functional group: forb, graminoid, evergreen shrub or deciduous shrub
genus: Scientific name of plant genus
species: Scientific name of plant species
phenophase: The phenological event observed (flower, flowerend, green, seedmat, senesce)

phenophase definitions: 

flower: date that the first flower was open, first pollen visible, or first anthers exposed
flowerend: date when anthers wilted or petals dropped
green:  date of leaf emergence, when the first leaf was visible or open 
seedmat: date when seeds are mature or fruits are ripe.
senesce: date when leaves start to change color if autumn

DOY: Day of year the phenophase was first observed (from 1 to 366)
snowfree_date: First snow free day of year per plot or study area if available (from 1 to 366)
data_provider: Name of the study area PI or data provider of the observation
data_provider_email: Email of the data provider

5. Uncertainty, precision, and accuracy of measurements, if known: 
Phenological observations were taken form once weekly to daily, depending on the study area.

6. Environmental conditions, if appropriate (e.g., cloud cover, atmospheric influences, etc.): N/A

7. Method(s) for processing data, if data other than raw data are being contributed: N/A

8. Standards or calibrations that were used: N/A

9. Specialized software (including version number) used to prepare and/or needed to read the dataset, if applicable: N/A

10: Quality assurance and quality control that have been applied, if applicable: This database was assembled and checked for obvious errors (e.g. unrealistic outliers, obvious typos) by Janet Prevey. However, we cannot ensure that the database is entirely free of errors (such as observations being improperly recorded on datasheets).

11. Known problems that limit the datas use or other caveats (e.g., uncertainty, sampling problems, blanks, QC samples): Blank cells indicate inapplicable or unknown values.

12. Date dataset was last modified: March 2, 2021

13. Related or ancillary datasets outside of this dataset, if applicable: Subsets of the data included here are included in the Polar data calatogue datasets #CCIN12961 and #CCIN12722
